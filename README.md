# **Calculator Project**
  A simple console application that asks for a number input, an operator (+,-,*,/), and a second number input. Then the app will calculate the result and display it.
  If the user enters invalid numbers (ie. letters/symbols) or an invalid operator, an error message will be displayed and the User must re-enter valid numbers and operators. Trying to divide by "0" will result in an error message and asking the user to try again.
  After a calculation, the user will be prompted to continue or entering "n" to end the application.
