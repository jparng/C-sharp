# **Calculator Project**
A simple console application that asks for a number input, an operator (+,-,*,/), and a second number input. Then the app will calculate the result and display it.
If the user enters invalid numbers (ie. letters/symbols) or an invalid operator, an error message will be displayed and the User must re-enter valid numbers and operators. Trying to divide by "0" will result in an error message and asking the user to try again.
After a calculation, the user will be prompted to continue or entering "n" to end the application.

# **Lab2**
A WFP application where the user enters something in the textbox and by clicking the copy button, the red "Display here" label will produce the message in the textbox.

#**Project2**
A WFP application that lets the user enter a first and last name, an age, the number of hours worked, and the rate per hour. When the user clicks the calculate button, a message will appear showing the name, age, hours worked, and pay earned.
